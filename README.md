# phpunit package

This is a simple PHPUnit test runner. This assumes that have PHPUnit installed and the executable exists (or symlinked to) `/usr/local/bin/phpunit`. 

You need to open the console to view results (`cmd-alt-i`)

Future updates will include a more graphically friendly version of results, as well as configuration in the Settings panel.
