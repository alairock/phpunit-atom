# phpunit package

This is a simple PHPUnit test runner. This assumes that have PHPUnit installed and the executable exists (or symlinked to) `/usr/local/bin/phpunit`. This can be changed in the preferences panel, if the location is different.

You need to open the console to view results (`cmd-alt-i`)

TODO:
Instead of puting the results inside the console, we should have it pop up in a window.
